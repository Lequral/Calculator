## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- SASS
- [Typescript's page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typescript
- [Svelte's page](https://svelte.dev/) - Svelte framework

### What I learned

I'm happy to finally finish this project. It was a way a for me to get into typescript, sass and especially svelte. I think choosing a framework was a big step in my web developpement journey, it facilitated a lot of the process, for example, making the screen update when you enter numbers etc... Now one thing I'm not happy with is how I got the themes to change. I tried multiple ways, having 3 scss files for each color theme but i couldn't find a way to globally change the color theme's file import on components.
